# 2. From the imaginary to the real world

In this second section, we will use a real IO database to calculate some consumption-based emissions accounts. But before we do this we need to revise functions and for-loops. This may already be familiar to you but take a look because we start to build the functions required later in this section.

Since making this video, I have developed further work on the carbon footprints of local areas and the carbon footprints of age groups.

UK local area footprints can be investigated here: https://localfootprint.uk/

and this article in The Guardian looks at footprints of different types of households: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/20/restaurants-pets-holidays-how-uk-well-off-have-outsize-carbon-footprints
